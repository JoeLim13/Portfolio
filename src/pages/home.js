            <b>HELLO</b>, welcome to my website. My name is Lim Ean Han. You can
            call me Joe if you like. Head over to <b>menu</b> and check out my
            portfolio. If you wish to head over to my social media(s), feel free

            <br></br>I will constantly update my website to make it more
            interactive for everyone of you. Currently, the website is not
            friendly to mobile user. I will update in the future, I promise.
            Last but not least, whenever a project is created by me, I will
            share it here. Stay tuned for more updates!
